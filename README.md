# Project Brainstorm
## Domain of Interest

**Why are we interested in this?**

We are interested in the field of finance/economics because we are business, economics, and computational finance majors. We feel like the field of finance/economics intersects all of our major-related interests.

**Examples of data driven projects related to finance/economics**
