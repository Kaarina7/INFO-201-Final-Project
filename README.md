# Project Brainstorm
## Domain of Interest

**Why are we interested in this?**

We are interested in the field of finance/economics because we are business, economics, and computational finance majors. We feel like the field of finance/economics intersects all of our major-related interests.

**Examples of data driven projects related to finance/economics**
- [Example 1:](https://www.kaggle.com/skirmer/fun-with-real-estate-data) This project looks at different factors which influence the market price of a house.
- [Example 2:](https://www.kaggle.com/rohan8594/finance-data-project)This project analyses data related to stock prices starting from the 2008 financial crisis up to 2016.

## Finding Data
**Data Source 1**
- https://data.world/zillow-data/median-list-price
- There are 6 tables in this set, all contained inside /data/zillow-data-median-list-price/
- This data was collected by Zillow, and it consists of averages of all the prices of homes listed on their website. The 6 tables are made up of these averages divided by geographic regions: ZIP code, State, Neighborhood, Metro area, County, and City. Each column represents a month, ranging from January 2010 to September 2017 in every table.
- The number of observations varies by geographic type. ZIP code: 10310 rows, 99 columns; State: 51 rows, 95 columns; Neighborhood: 1790 rows, 99 columns; Metro area: 878 rows, 95 columns; County: 2290 rows, 99 columns; City: 7120 rows, 98 columns.
- This dataset can be used to answer questions about how house prices vary by geographic region, as well as how they've changed over the past ten years. In conjunction with other data about income and rent prices that Zillow makes publicly available, this data could also be used to answer questions about cost of living.
